							<h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
							<p>I am introducing my specialty here, which is cooking. I hope you can understand my specialty.
								 I will introduce the dishes I have cooked and share my cooking experience.</p>
							<p>I have loved and been passionate about cooking since I was a child. Over time, 
								I not only learned basic cooking techniques but also began to explore a variety of different cuisines.
								 Cooking is not only about satisfying the desire for food but also a process of creation. 
								 The sense of accomplishment I feel every time I share my culinary creations with family and friends is indescribable.</p>

							<div>This was my first time cooking and the experience will stay with me for a long time.
								 Steamed eggs may seem like a simple dish, but I encountered many challenges before I finally succeeded. 
								 For example, I learned that steaming for too long or too short can seriously affect the taste. </div>
							<div>At the beginning, my knowledge of steamed eggs was very superficial.
								 I thought the process was simple: just beat the eggs, add water, 
								 mix well, and put everything in the steamer. However, 
								 in practice I found that if you steam them for too long, 
								 the eggs become less elastic and lose their smooth texture. 
								 These initial failures taught me that timing the steaming of eggs is crucial</div>
							<div>To improve, I began to carefully observe and record the steaming time and heat of each attempt.
								 I tried different ratios of water to eggs and gradually found the one that worked best. Every success boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of the dish. 
								 Eventually, I learned to adjust the steaming time based on the characteristics of the steamer and the amount of heat, and finally mastered the perfect steamed egg recipe.</div>
							<div>This cooking experience not only taught me how to cook steamed eggs, but also allowed me to appreciate the fun and challenges of cooking.
								 Every little detail affects the final product and that is part of the beauty of the culinary art. 
								 I look forward to continuing to explore cooking and creating more delicious dishes in the future.</div>

								<h3>Honey & Lemon Cake</h3>
								<p>I was mixing the batter while listening to my favorite music and feeling very happy. 
									Next, it occurred to me that I could add some nuts to round out the dish.
									 So, I took the chopped walnuts and added them to the batter. 
									 This makes me look forward to the final product.</p>

								<h3>Brownie</h3>
								<p>I was in the middle of making brownies when I realized I didn’t have enough eggs in the fridge. 
									I had planned to use three eggs but could only find two! This year, 
									I had a flash of inspiration and remembered that a friend once told me to replace eggs with bananas. So,
									 I pulled out a cooked one, mashed it into a paste, and added it to the batter. Not only does this solve the problem,
									  it also adds a unique banana flavor to the brownies.</p>

								<h3> Egg With Tomatoes</h3>
								<p>When I was beating the eggs, I was in a hurry and the eggshell fell into the bowl. 
									I stopped, thinking about the method my mother taught me, 
									and quickly scooped out the shell with chopsticks. This little accident made me cautious.</p>

								<h3>Honey Pork Ribs</h3>
								<p>When cooking the ribs, I was attracted by the aroma in the kitchen and forgot the time, and almost let the ribs burn! Fortunately, 
									I discovered it in time and quickly turned down the fire. This made me sigh at the patience and concentration required in cooking, and not being impatient. 
									This little episode also reminded me of what my mother needed to say: “In the kitchen, focus is the most important thing.”</p>

								<h3>Tiramisu</h3>
								<p>The inspiration for making tiramisu this time came from a trip. I remember having their tiramisu in a small town in Italy that used honey and vanilla and I was very impressed. 
									After I got home,
									 I kept thinking about how to incorporate this element into my favorite tiramisu, and this time I finally made it happen.</p>

								<h3>Cola Chicken Wings</h3>
								<p>When I decided to make cola chicken wings, a scene of gathering with friends came to my mind. 
									I remember one time when we had a family gathering, the cola chicken wings brought by a friend were praised by everyone. 
									The combination of sweet and salty taste makes you want to take another bite. This time I decided to do it myself.</p>

								Prepare all necessary ingredients, keep the work area clean, check that the stove is functioning properly, 
								and prepare the necessary cooking equipment (such as steamers, ovens, etc.).Before I cook, I plan out the recipes and ingredients needed so I can avoid rushing at the last minute. 
								The checklist keeps me organized and prepared, ensuring that all materials are on hand.<br> For example, in the process of cooking cola chicken wings, 
								I deeply realized the importance of marinating. Letting the ingredients marinate in advance not only enhances the flavor, but also gives the whole dish a layered feel.

							<div class="accordion-body">
								With fresh spices, a moderate amount of sweetness can counteract spicy or sour flavors, especially when used in sauces.Salt not only enhances the taste,
								 but also highlights the umami flavor of the ingredients. Be careful not to add too much, add it in portions, gradually add seasonings during the cooking process, 
								 taste at any time, and avoid too much at one time.<br>In cola chicken wings, the sweetness comes from the cola, and the saltiness comes from the marinade.
								  Such a combination allows the flavors to complement each other, 
								 and considering how to balance sweet and salty when seasoning can make the dish more appealing.

								Learning basic cutting techniques, such as dicing, slicing, and chopping, will help the ingredients cook more evenly.
								 Understanding the cooking time of different ingredients and knowing when to use high and low heat will help.<br>Learning online and watching cooking instructional videos helps me learn new techniques and recipes.
								  These resources allow me to improve my cooking skills anytime and anywhere.

							<div class="accordion-body">
								Using different colored ingredients, such as green cilantro, red tomatoes, and yellow bell peppers, can make dinner look more practical.
								<br>When making tomato scrambled eggs and tiramisu, color matching can enhance the visual appeal of the dish. In scrambled eggs with tomatoes, 
								the bright red tomatoes and golden eggs complement each other,
								 while the verdant green of onions adds a freshness to the whole dish. <br>In tiramisu, the white color of mascarpone cheese and the dark brown color of coffee form layers, 
								 while the sprinkled cocoa powder provides contrast, making the dessert more eye-catching. This color combination not only makes the main dishes and desserts look delicious, 
								 but also makes the table present a colorful visual effect, enhancing the overall dining experience!

								Using fresh herbs, spices, and produce can dramatically enhance the flavor of a dish. Fresh herbs like basil, 
								cilantro, and rosemary not only add a refreshing aroma but also enhance the color and taste of dishes.
								<br>Using fresh organic eggs in brownies can improve the quality of baking and make the finished product more fluffy.
								Add fresh fruits like strawberries or blueberries to tiramisu
